              A lot of work goes into taking a photograph. Before the inevitable
              ‘click’ — chances are you spent time planning what gear you’d
              bring, checking the weather conditions for the day, experimenting
              with camera settings, and finding the perfect framing for your
              shot.

              But what happens next is equally transformative.

              Editing. Some photographers love it, many simply put up with it —
              but the reality is: editing has the power to elevate and enhance
              what you’ve worked hard to capture. We spoke with three Unsplash
              contributors about all things editing — from their top tips for
              beginners looking to improve their skills, to their approach to
              the editing process.

              <strong class="heading">Simone Hutsch</strong> : is a graphic
              designer from Berlin, Germany currently living in London, UK.
              While photography was always a part of her studies, she only
              really got into architecture photography after she graduated. It
              served as a creative outlet. She says, “I first started
              photography as a personal creative project outside of work, and
              that’s still the case. I see this as a journey, and what matters
              to me is that every day I get a tiny bit better and truly enjoy
              what I’m doing.”
            </p>
            <p class="desc article-content">
              <strong class="heading">Philipp Pilz</strong> : is also a
              designer. But for him, photography has been part of his life since
              childhood. He first recalls taking photos of cars as a child with
              a “cheap plastic film camera” before taking party pictures in
              clubs as a teenager. While he’s been photographing for about 20
              years now, it was only when he turned to nature in the last four
              years that he believes truly found his style. Now, he travels
              through Europe in his camper van in search of exciting motifs and
              wild sceneries.
            </p>
            <p class="desc article-content">
              <strong class="heading">Lerone Pieters</strong> : first took up
              photography as a hobby as a teenager, before getting more serious
              about it thanks to encouragement from his friends and family, as
              well as an ambition and drive to improve his skills. He says, “I
              became increasingly interested in finding my niche and eventually
              pushing past my comfort zone.” Today, he focuses on street
              photography and portraits.

            The Editing Process

            <p class="desc article-content">
              <strong class="heading">Philipp typically</strong> : works in
              Adobe Lightroom, and in Photoshop on rare occaision. His editing
              process typically goes something like this: “The first thing I do
              is apply the color look to my images. This is a custom preset that
              I developed and refined over a long process. This setting includes
              pretty much all the controls that are available in Adobe
              Lightroom: Color, Calibration, Tone Curves, and so on. After that
              comes the local adjustments — bringing out certain areas and
              darkening others again. Finally, I clean up the image, removing
              anything that might interfere with the view of the subject.”
            </p>
            <p class="desc article-content">
              With Simone, her retouching process begins before reaching her
              computer. She explains, “My retouching process requires quite a
              lot of imagination and creativity, before I start, I make sure I’m
              in the right headspace: I would go for a long relaxing bike ride
              before or I’d put my favourite playlist on.”
            </p>
            <p class="desc article-content">
              When it’s time to sit down and edit, for Simone, it’s all about
              experimentation. She explains, “I try a few different edits on one
              photo (colours/composition, etc.) and I always consider the bigger
              picture before I decide on the final edit.” She uses Photoshop
              because of the “freedom it provides.”
            </p>
            <p class="desc article-content">
              “It’s a process of playing around, because only when you start to
              play with it can you let your creative mind be free. For example,
              instead of just cutting out a whole building from the background,
              I’ll take a facade, reflect it, or perspective-transform it in
              order to distort the layer and give it the perspective of receding
              into the distance. I’ll also cut out one story of a building and
              duplicate it multiple times instead of simply showing all the
              stories.”

              Ultimately, the key to enjoying editing? Embracing it for what it
              is. For Simone, what she loves most is “the contrast of being
              outside in the real world and then diving into the virtual
              ‘Photoshop Universe’.”

              Philipp also enjoys the contrast between photography and editing.
              In fact, he almost prefers it to taking the photos themselves. “It
              probably has something to do with the convenience of sitting at
              home in an armchair rather than setting the alarm for 4am to
              photograph the sunrise on the French cliffs.”
